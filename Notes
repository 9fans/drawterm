Win32 port Notes:

* Issues:

	** ownership questions on files are completely deferred by
	marking them as unknown.  It works for now, but probably
	should be handled correctly.

	** No performance measurements have been done.  The interactive
	response seems faster than old drawterm, but the i/o seems
	slower.

	** fs functions in devntfs.c need to handle conversions to/from
	widechar and utf-8.
