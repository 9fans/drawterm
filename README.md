INSTALLATION
--------------
To build on Unix, run CONF=unix make.

To build on Solaris using Sun cc, run CONF=sun make.

To build on AIX using IBM XL C, run CONF=aix make.

To build on Windows, you need Mingw.  See http://www.mingw.org.
Edit Make.config to uncomment the Windows section
and comment out the rest.  Then run CONF=win32 make.

(You can download nmake from 
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q132084
Rename it to make.exe and put it in your path somewhere.
)

I haven't tested the Windows build on Windows itself.
I cross-compile using mingw32 on Linux.
